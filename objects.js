//Assign an object to the variable playlist and initialize the object with a key-value pair â€” the keys will be artist names and the values will be song titles. (What limitation does this impose on our playlist?)

var playlist = {
  Beyonce: "Nights",
  Solange: "Cranes in the Sky"
}

//Create a function updatePlaylist that accepts three parameters: the playlist (an object), an artist name (a string), and a song title. The body of the function should add the song and artist as a key-value pair to the playlist object. The function should return the whole playlist.
